# 📡 Crypto Project Risk Radar

**Educational, AI-assisted research pipeline for evaluating risk and tradeoffs of emerging cryptocurrency projects**
*(Research only — not financial advice)*

---

## Overview

**Crypto Project Risk Radar** is an educational project that explores how modern software engineering and AI-assisted workflows can be used to **systematically evaluate risk, transparency, and tradeoffs** of newly emerging cryptocurrency projects.

Rather than making predictions or recommendations, this project focuses on producing **structured research artifacts**:

* transparent scoring rubrics
* explicit assumptions
* reproducible outputs
* human-readable risk narratives

The project is intentionally designed as a **learning spine** that evolves across clearly defined milestones, reinforcing core computer science, software engineering, and AI collaboration concepts.

---

## Motivation

The cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves rapidly, often faster than traditional due-diligence processes. This creates an opportunity to explore:

* how structured risk frameworks can be encoded in software
* how AI can assist research *without replacing human judgment*
* how analytical tools can remain transparent, auditable, and ethical

This repository exists to **practice those skills**, not to deliver authoritative evaluations.

---

## What This Project Does

At its core, Crypto Project Risk Radar:

* Accepts structured descriptions of crypto projects
* Applies a transparent, deterministic **risk rubric**
* Produces a **Risk Report** containing:

  * an overall risk score
  * factor-level score breakdowns
  * explanatory notes

As milestones progress, the system evolves to include:

* reproducibility and audit artifacts
* validated, tool-callable interfaces
* comparative ecosystem context
* AI-assisted research workflows

## What This Project Is *Not*

To avoid misuse or misinterpretation, this project explicitly does **not**:

* provide investment advice or recommendations
* rank projects as “good” or “bad” investments
* predict price movements or market performance
* operate as a trading signal or portfolio tool
* replicate or compete with commercial due-diligence platforms

Any outputs should be interpreted as **educational research examples only**.

## Milestone-Driven Design

This repository is intentionally structured around **incremental milestones**, each aligned with a broader CS + AI lesson plan.

| Milestone | Focus                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | Deterministic risk rubric engine               |
| 2         | Reproducibility & assumption discipline        |
| 3         | Tool-callable, validated development component |
| 4         | Data ingestion & provenance                    |
| 5         | Ecosystem comparison & context                 |
| 6         | Explainability & narrative reports             |
| 7         | Orchestration & pipelines                      |
| 8         | Agent-assisted research (bounded)              |
| 9         | Bias & failure analysis                        |
| 10        | Release-grade educational artifact             |

Each milestone introduces **new concepts without retroactive refactoring**, mirroring how real analytical systems evolve.
